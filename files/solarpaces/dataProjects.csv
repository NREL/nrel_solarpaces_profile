Andasol-1 is the first parabolic trough power plant in Europe. Located in southern Spain, this 300 million Euro power plant has been under construction since June 2006 and began operating in 2008. The nominal production capacity of 50 megawatts is enough electricity for up to 200,000 people. A two-tank indirect thermal storage system holds 28,500 tons of molten salt, and this reservoir can run the turbine for up to 7.5 hours at full load. Andasol-1 and two upcoming companion plants will help the Spanish power grid meet peak summer demand primarily caused by the high energy consumption of air conditioning units.",photo_anda_sol.jpg,"Photo of four sections of parabolic troughs segmented by access roads, with each section having about 100 rows of troughs.
